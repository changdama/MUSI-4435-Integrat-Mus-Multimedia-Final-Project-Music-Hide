AR-based multiplayer musical treasure hunt

Is there a relationship between architecture, music, and human cognition?

#Description#
- We built an AR-based multiplayer musical treasure hunt. We used
Apple’s AR frameworks - RealityKit and ARKit for development and
our target devices were iPhones and iPads.
- This game was developed to be a ‘Participant’ DGD1 category, but it’s
interesting that we noticed people playing it as a ‘Wanderer’ where
even though they found all the chords, they’d still go around to
explore the environment.
